# UWS IS *NOT* AN ELECTRON MODULE
`uws` is a replacement module for `ws` which allows, but doesn't guarantee (certainly not when paired with Socket.IO), significant performance and memory-usage improvements. This module is specifically *only* compatible with Node.js and is installed *only* like so:

`npm install uws`

* uws *can* use node-gyp and *can* recompile itself at installation but does *not* require so.
* npm installation never fails, but `require('uws')` will throw if all of the below points hold true:
  * There was no C++11 compiler available at installation.
  * Your system is not an official **Tier 1** Node.js platform.
  
## Keep in mind
You can't fix a clogged up system by only fixing part of the problem. Swapping to uws can have *dramatical* effects if your entire pipeline works well. Socket.IO, SocketCluster and other such mass bloat will **not** give you desired results as those projects already, from the start, **are** the bottleneck.

## Usage
`uws` tries to mimic `ws` as closely as possible without sacrificing too much performance. In most cases you simply swap `require('ws')` with `require('uws')`:

```javascript
var WebSocketServer = require('uws').Server;
var wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 3000 });

function onMessage(message) {
    console.log('received: ' + message);
}

wss.on('connection', function(ws) {
    ws.on('message', onMessage);
    ws.send('something');
});
```

##### Deviations from ws
There are some important incompatibilities with `ws` though, we aim to be ~90% compatible but will never implement behavior that is deemed too inefficient:

* Binary data is passed zero-copy as an `ArrayBuffer`. This means you need to copy it to keep it past the callback. It also means you need to convert it with `Buffer.from(message)` if you expect a `Node.js Buffer`.
* `webSocket._socket` is not a `net.Socket`, it is just a getter function with very basic functionalities.
* `webSocket._socket.remote...` might fail, you need to cache it at connection.
* `webSocket` acts like an `EventEmitter` with one listener per event maximum.
* `webSocket.upgradeReq` is only valid during execution of the connection handler. If you want to keep properties of the upgradeReq for the entire lifetime of the webSocket you better attach that specific property to the webSocket at connection.

# It is time to upgrade to uWebSockets.js!

## Go to [https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js).

## Use of old "uws" releases is not recommended due to known bugs and problems.

## To correct nonsensical slanderous stories and wild speculation, I have published text on [Medium](https://medium.com/@alexhultman/beware-of-tin-foil-hattery-f738b620468c). Please have a read.
